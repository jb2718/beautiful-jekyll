# "Smallify" It, Sam! - The Simplification Problem Solving Strategy 


So I've been working on getting better at programming with Ruby lately.  One of the projects I worked on in this process was creating a console game similar to Blackjack.  After I finished working on that project, the idea popped into my mind "Wouldn't it be cool to try to make a more complicated card game like Uno?  You love Uno!"  Ideas pop up all of the time - just as carefreely as toast popping out of a toaster.

It's quite easy to generate "wouldn't it be cool if - " ideas.  Making those ideas happen is not always so friction free.  I've gone through several starts and stops on this Uno project.  I don't know about you, but I watched a lot of Looney Tunes when I was growing up.  There is an episode, "Hare Trigger," with Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny where Sam finds himself literally drawing a gun on a sheet of paper.  He works earnestly and has to erase and try again as he goes.

That is what the Uno game process has felt like.  I've planned out my work, started coding, and run into walls.  I've balled up the proverbial sheet of paper, tossed it, and started over only to code myself into tangles of class responsibility.  So now I'm going to take a step back and try another strategy.  My new strategy is to try to "smallify" the problem/project.  I know, I know...I hear your protests: "but "smallify" is not a real word (it's actually wooden like Pinocchio).  Given this essay is not in French, and I don't have to worry about demerits from the Académie Française => I will therefore continue tossing out fabricated words with constrained abandon.  QED.

The idea is to keep reducing the complexity of the project until a clearer plan for how to handle to problem comes into focus.
