My mom gave me a book called “A Beautiful Question” by Frank Wilczek as a gift over the holidays last year. I’ve only now gotten the chance to start reading it, and…what a great present! The book opens with the question that is the title of this post: Does the World Embody Beautiful Ideas?  The author takes time to explore the idea that Mother Nature is herself an artist given to expressing beauty in her own style.  Marks of her style include structural symmetry, repetition, and pattern.  One way to think of numbers, then would be as some sort of script particularly well suited to help us document Mother Nature's work.

It is interesting to contemplate these ideas and think about seemingly familiar concepts in novel ways.  I remember the first time I had a major shift in the way that I thought about numbers and mathematics.  I was walking by a McDonald's on the way to campus from my college dorm when I ran ran into a classmate.  We’ll call him Caesar.

I knew Caesar from a painting class. I had been taking various math and art classes at the time and at some point we got into a discussion about numbers. During the conversation, he said something to the effect of “I always thought of numbers as elements on the periodic table.”  That was the first time it clicked that numbers were objects that could be studied for their own individual properties and interactions with other numbers.

I’ll never forget that conversation because up until that moment, I had been engaging with numbers at such a surface level. Even though I was broadening my exposure to mathematics by taking classes, I was missing a very beautiful aspect of the study of numbers and patterns. I was caught up in trying to memorize recipes for how to calculate this or that and did not see how numbers were windows into greater truths about the nature of things.  Furthermore, they were objects to be observed and explored like the subjects of the still life paintings we worked on in class.

Frank Wilczek's book promises to present more of these perspective shifting ideas.  I look forward to find what it has in store.  I must also thank my mom for such a great present and Caesar for opening my mind to a new way of thinking.
