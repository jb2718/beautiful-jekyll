I received a book called “A Beautiful Question” by Frank Wilczek as a gift over the holidays last year. I’ve only now gotten the chance to start reading it, and…what a great present! The book opens with the question that is the title of this post. I think of numbers as some sort of script that seeks to snapshot vast moving bodies of patterns.

I remember the first time it clicked that numbers were objects that could be studied for their own individual properties and their interactions with other numbers. I was walking down the street and ran into a classmate, we’ll call him Willie, from a painting class. I had been taking various math and art classes at the time and at some point we got into a discussion about numbers. During the conversation, he said something to the effect of “I always thought of numbers as elements on the periodic table.”

I’ll never forget that conversation…well, as long as I have the capacity to not forget. Up until that moment, I had been engaging with numbers at such a surface level. Even though I was broadening my exposure to mathematics, I was missing the beautiful part about the study of numbers and patterns. I was caught up in trying to memorize formulas and recipes for how to do this or that and did not see how numbers were windows into greater truths about the nature of things.

This book promises to dive into the exploration of whether the nature of the world is to express beauty. Interesting question!

So, thanks, mom for the book! And thank you, Willie, for that conversation many moons ago.
